// app.use(): This is like telling your server, "Hey, when you get a request, make sure to run some code before sending a response."
// "/api/auth": Imagine this as a specific area in your website. If someone tries to go to any address that starts with /api/auth, we want to do something special.
// authRouter: Think of this like a set of instructions. When someone goes to a URL starting with /api/auth, follow these instructions to handle their request.
